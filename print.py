    "What is the overall sentiment of posts?": "The average sentiment score of the dataset is 0.16, indicating a neutral tone overall. However, Reels tend to have more negative sentiment due to controversial topics.",

    "How can we reduce negative sentiment?": "Reducing negative sentiment can be done by avoiding controversial topics and focusing on positive, uplifting content."
